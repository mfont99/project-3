    <h1>What's Our mission</h1>
    <p>During the course of this project we're targeting an indepth analysis of the opioid pandemic 
        as it relates to morality rates across the country. We were able to gather some open data 
        sources across the web and through the power of Data Engineering and Visualizations we came 
        up with the below synopsis as told through the power of fancy maps and charts 
        <br> Eventually what we ended up finding even more interesting was an even deeper dive into
    looking at the opioid presccription rates and its relationship to the mortality rates. 
    We decided to zone into the most affected areas and see what are the local opioids prescription trends over time
    and summize if there is any correlation between the high mortality rates and prescription rates</br></p>
    <h2><center>Annual Age Adjusted Death Rate (>30) per County</center></h2>

    <h1>Welcome to the Appalachian</h1>
    <P>We came to see that amongst all the states, a high concentration of the counties with highest death rates 
        through a span of 15+ year, a majority of them were in the appalachian region of the country 
        (see Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee)</P>

    <P>So what do we see with the prescription rates in these states compared to national numbers?</P>
